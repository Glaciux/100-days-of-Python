So I have decided to task myself to see how uncomfortable I can get to learn Python and upskill.
I'll use Angela Yu's Udemy course as well as DataCamp, FreeCodeCamp, & YouTube tutorials.
I'll try to document my progress on Twitter too with the hashtag #100daysofPython.

Gambari!!!


N.B ( I'll try to improve my Git and Linux skills as well.)
